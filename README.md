## LICENSE

This work is derived from GeoJSON specs and schema code from

- https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7946
- https://github.com/jazzband/geojson/blob/master/LICENSE.rst
    - BSD 3 license
- https://github.com/geojson/schema/blob/master/license.md
    - MIT license

This python module is covered by the Apache 2 license, as it is primarily a
translation of GeoJSON specs and schemas into python utilities that
relies mainly on the JSON schemas from https://github.com/geojson/schema.
Since the Apache 2 and MIT licenses are compatible, this implementation can
be bundled in an Apache 2 license.
